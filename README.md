# Routify

The idea for routify was started when two friends (Vanshaj) and (Ganesh) were planning their summer vacation trip to New York City and were figuring out how far 
several destinations were from their hotel and they came to realize that as you add multiple stops on Google Maps, it doesn't optimize the route to make your rote 
as efficient as possible, rather it just does it in the order you put the stops. To tourists and travelers like us, there is often times when the exact order of the 
stops does not matter so if we could save time and have the most efficient route figured out, we would definitely take that. That is where a real world problem led 
us to collaboratively come up with the idea to design and work on Routify. 

Routify is a chrome extension that will work with Google Maps and will help you optimize your multi-destination stops in order of efficiency based on whether the user
chooses to order the stops based on least number of miles or by estimated time on routes based on live traffic updates by Google. The user will choose the starting 
destination and the final destination and then list the addresses of however many stops they want in the middle and Routify will sort the middle stops and effectively
optimize the route based on the users needs. It is coded using Javascript, HTML, and CSS in Visual Studio Code.
